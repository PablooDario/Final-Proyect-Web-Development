# TIMETABLE CHOICES FOR TEACHERS 

Software tool designed to support the choice and implementation of school activities for the coming semester, designed for teachers and administrators.

This administration system was created by 4 students; the languages and tools used were JS, HTML5, CSS3, PHP, MySQL and some frameworks such as materialize.

This system could present not so new technologies since this project was made to introduce us to web development.

For its use, the database should be created with the script provided in the Commands.sql file and a server such as XAMPP should be used.
